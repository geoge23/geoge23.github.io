He was quick to understand project needs, and when roadblocks appeared, when possible, he came up with quick workarounds. He handed over the project in detail and made sure I understood how to work with the tech. He worked with patience, curiosity, and quite a lot of creativity. I’m very glad I met and hired him!"

> "George did an extraordinary job on my project! He is very efficient and took time to understand the requirements and proposed a draft plan of his solution before starting to work on it. This saved a lot of time down the road. In addition, he has a good command of the recent front-end development technologies as well as system knowledge of how to actually deploy solutions. I expected this project to take a week, but George finished it in about two days. His code is well organized and easy to read with just the right amount of comments to help maintain the solution."

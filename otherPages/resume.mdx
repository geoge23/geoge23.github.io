> "George did an extraordinary job on my project! he is very efficient and took time to understand the requirements and proposed a draft plan of his solution before starting to work on it. This saved a lot of time down the road. In addition, he has a good command of the recent front-end development technologies as well as system knowledge of how to actually deploy solutions. I expected this project to take a week but George finished it in about two days. His code is well organized and easy to read with just the right amount of comments to help maintain the solution."

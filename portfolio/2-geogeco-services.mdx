As a personal goal, I try to avoid using paid cloud infrastructure to cut down on costs and better understand how the systems we use on a daily basis actually work. GCS is the culmination of several projects forming the network infrastructure across my home, serving hundreds of gigabytes monthly both in- and out-of-home. Currently, this network supports daily operations for the WADaily project, my Home Assistant instance, several databases, and other personal projects. A topology diagram is embedded below.

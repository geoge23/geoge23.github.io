Lab Management Asset Organizer, also known as LMAO, is an inventory system developed for use in Georgia Tech Research Institute's Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory.
It was built for deployment across EOSL's several labs in order to manage checkouts for expensive lab equipment and reduce the likelihood that this equipment disappears. 

The system runs between two computers, a thin client and server. This is because GTRI imposes strict requirements for what can connect to the local network, so using
a Linux client by itself was forbidden. I settled on the diagram below, using a preapproved Windows computer and some creative use of Task Scheduler to launch a server on
boot without requiring a GTRI user's login. The Pi client is airgapped other than its connection to the server to ensure it can't be used as an attack vector.

I wrote the code in Python, using Flask for the server and PyQT5 for the client. The Flask part was straightforward, however this was my first time using QT, and I had to implement several things to ensure my program worked
as intended. 

For instance, the app we created works like a single-page app in the browser, so I needed a page router to change which screen we saw throughout the app. QT, however, does not provide this, so I implemented my own which
mimics the system found in react-router. It allows creation of routes and navigation between these routes, as well as query parameters to be attached when traveling to new routes. I also implemented a global state store similar to Redux
so that I could store state about the user that's currently logged in. The state manager also allowed for the rebuilding of pages when state data changes (i.e. when the user logs out and another logs in).

I also implemented drivers to access data from the scanner and RFID reader, which made use of threading to avoid blocking the application while data is parsed. I also used threading for making HTTP requests from the client to the server, 
which allowed me to show loading screens and keep the app responsive even during blocking I/O.

The UI was also built with my best approximation of components, another thing that QT doesn't quite support. These components are designed to be reusable, cutting down drastically on development time.

If you're interested, I attached a video of my presentation, which goes into more detail about the implementation of the system and its various parts.

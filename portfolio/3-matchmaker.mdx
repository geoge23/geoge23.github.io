Project Matchmaker is a viral quiz produced for a student newspaper. Essentially, it functions by taking student responses to survey questions along with a few parameters to calculate quiz similarity between peers. This data is then used to curate "matches", which are emailed at the conclusion of the survey to the individuals. 

This project uses React on the frontend to create an elegant, themed UI for answering questions. Question data is saved to the user's browser local storage in order to persist answers between visits. This data is POSTed restfully to the backend server running NodeJS, which performs answer validation and records student answers. At the completion of the survey period (when all students have answered), the poll is closed via a CloudFlare redirect to a complete screen. This then triggers a Docker container which runs a matching algorithm to determine similarity. The similarity data is then placed in an email template and sent to survey respondants.

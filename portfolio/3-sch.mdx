Schedule Check is a tool used for comparing schedules for Woodward Academy students before class begins in August. It works by taking the schedule PDF sent from school and scraping it for information about a student's classes.
It then adds them to its internal store of class rosters and allows those rosters to be viewed by other students in the class. The system runs in NodeJS with Express and MJS, and all pages are
completely server-side rendered. The service was marketed through social media utilizing call-to-actions asking for shares via Snapchat. This allowed our system to collect data from >50% of the school
and >85% of the senior class, racking up 40k page views while the system was online.

This project consisted of converting an interactive Excel spreadsheet into a responsive web application to be embedded on a client's Kartra site. Each column was converted using a macro from Excel formulas to JavaScript, then the resulting values were displayed in a VueJS frontend. This widget helped drive engagement on the client site, boosting conversions to sales of their nutritional plans and consultation services.

The client noted the utility and efficiency of my services, stating that
>"It’s been a pleasure to work [with] George. He’s smart, responsive, delivers great work and practices with good professionalism and work ethic. He was quick to understand project needs, and when roadblocks appeared, when possible, he came up with quick workarounds. He handed over the project in detail and made sure I understood how to work with the tech. He worked with patience, curiosity and quite a lot of creativity. I’m very glad I met and hired him!"

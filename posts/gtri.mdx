I just completed my internship at Georgia Tech Research Institute, and it was an experience I'm sure I'll look back on fondly in the future. 
I met people who spoke my language, and I felt like I always fit in with the other students and mentors across the program. 
I'd like to give a special mention to Matthew Arceri and Chase Johnston, who were my mentors throughout the internship and made my experience 10x better.
Overall, I could definitely see myself working in this kind of environment, with fast-paced development to go along with research. I found the organizational structure to be the most attractive; most
teams were completely in control of small projects, meaning they had complete autonomy in their implementation. This is in contrast to other companies where there appears to be much more bureaucracy that works to stifle efficiency and innovation.
Unfortunately, I can't disclose much more about my specific project due to their strict research security policy (or something else I signed away in their 93-page onboarding contract), 
but I can include a video of my final presentation to give an idea of the project I worked on.

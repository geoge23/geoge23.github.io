I'm not the best gift-giver. Sometimes I can't really think of what to get people close to me. But when in doubt, resort to things meaningful to you. 
Being the maker that I am, I decided to make a project for my girlfriend. I wanted to make something that would be a reminder of our relationship, and 
something that would be a constant reminder of how much I love her.

But this was Christmas break, and I have no tools, no stores, and little equipment. But what I did have was a stolen ream of WS2812B LEDs from my school.
I started CADing some designs for potential projects I could do with LEDs and a 3D printer, but I couldn't find anything that I really liked. While 
scrolling TikTok one day, I stumbled upon the idea of long-distance lamps. I thought it was a really cool idea, and I wanted to make one for my girlfriend.

I started by designing a lamp in Fusion 360. I wanted it to be a simple design, so I decided to make it a simple cylinder with two plates to place a message
display. However, I would hit a snag. Both of the printers in my home (an Ender 3 Pro and a Flashforge Creator Pro) decided to give up for the holidays.
I needed to fab this design with no computer assistance. 

So I made a trip to Home Depot, where I quickly picked up a large sheet of MDF, some acrylic sheets, and some bits. However, without a router, I would need to
cut these pieces manually. By using a combination of drilling, jigsaws, and sanding, I was able to cut the pieces to size. I then realized with the acrylic
being see-through, it didn't really get the vibe I wanted. I picked up some spray-on frosted glass paint, and I was able to get the look I wanted.

I needed a coil to wrap the lights around, but unfortunately I was without a 3D printer. I decided to make a coil out of some toilet paper tubes, which I then
glued to the bottom plate assembly.

Finally, I wired and soldered up a board using some remaining perfboard from my house. I assembled the side panels and connected them to the housing with glue.
I then connected the LEDs to the board, and I was able to test it out. The display you can see on top allows me to add messages to the lamp, which I can change
using a web interface I wrote. I then added a power supply and a switch, and I was done!

While I don't love that the top assembly just hangs there, I was completely out of equipment at this point, so I pressed on. I threw together a web UI (pictured
below) which allows changing the message on the lamp, and I was able to send messages to the lamp from my phone. I also added an NFC tag which is pre-programmed
with the MAC address for the lamp, allowing quick access to the lamp interface.

I then wrapped the lamp in some bubble wrap and put it in a box. I then drove to my girlfriend's house, and I gave her the lamp. She was very happy with it, and
I was very happy with how it turned out. I was able to make a gift that was meaningful to me, and I was able to make something that she would love.
